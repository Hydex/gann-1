GANN - Clear meaning
--------------------

GANN is a combination of GA, for genetic algorithme, and ANN, for Artificial Neural Network.
This project will join these to notions into one single algorithme.

First part : ANN
----------------

We want to create a simple neural network in order to solve the XOR logic gate. The easeiest way to do it is by changing the wieghts through the backretropropagation algorithme. Unless this time, we are trying a whole new method to approach the solution.

Second part : GA
-----------------

That's when the genetic algos come handy : we use a simple population of neural networks to
